    "1. **List overlap**\n",
    "\n",
    "Take two lists, say for example these two:\n",
    "\n",
    "\ta = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]\n",
    "\tb = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]\n",
    "    \n",
    "and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **List comprehensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck you can take a look at the solutions for hw_03 number 1. One of the solutions uses a list comprehension to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **List overlap and list comprehension combined**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rewrite your solution to problem 1, using list comprehension this time to solve the problem."
